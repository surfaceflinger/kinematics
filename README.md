## TODO

### Nix stuff

 - fetching maps from gamebanana purely
 - treefmt
 - nixos module
 - systemd hardening

### plugin

 - switching maps from chat
 - it should adjust vars depending on current mode eg. kz or surf.
 - changing difficulty

most probably no permission system will be implemented as this thing is going to be used mainly for me binge-playing during boring calls at work.

research if i have to use sourcepawn or if lua could be used
research what the fuck is fastdl and if its needed for clients to pull maps, idc much about speed.
